# Algorithm Challenge #20 – Circle Area Inscribed in a Square

## 🧮 Problem Description
This challenge calculates the **area of a circle** that is **inscribed inside a square** — meaning the circle touches all four sides of the square from the inside.

---

## 🧠 Formula
\[
\text{Area} = \frac{\pi \times \text{side}^2}{4}
\]

---

## 💡 What You’ll Learn
- How to apply geometry formulas in C++  
- How to use constants (`const`) for π  
- The relationship between a square’s side and a circle’s diameter  
- Practicing math operations with proper parentheses  

---

## 🧩 Example
**Input:**  
Enter the side length of the square: 8

**Output:**  
The area of the circle inscribed in the square is: 50.2654
